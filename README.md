**Minecraft admin GUI** for Paper servers. Protects commands so only the owner can use them.

**Expect very many bugs**⚠️
ALWAYS USE THE LATEST RELEASE!!!
---

## Features

- **Username-protected commands** – only the owner can run them.  
- **Remove overworld enemies** with `/ashclean`.  
- **Admin GUI** via `/consolx`, includes:
  - TNT bomb – big boom
  - Immortality – cannot drop below 0.5 hearts, `/kill` cannot kill you
  - Grant OP
  - Remove abilities – de-op and remove immortality
- Small cooldown so inventory doesn’t bug out, if you can not pickup items from creative inventory or chest just wait <30sec
- **Book ban⚡** with this plugin enabled if you make a book named "ban", signed by "String OWNER" and only contains the word "ban" then if you drop that book, you will get yourself a chunkban. Anyone else who tries to enter gets banned if your server is not laggy ofc.
- **Open-source** nothing is encrypted and every line of code is visible.

## Installation

1. Install **Java JDK** (needed to compile and build the plugin).  
2. Make sure your **PATH** is set so `javac` and `jar` work in the terminal.  
3. Extract `AsherPlugin.rar` into a folder.  
4. Open `AutoBuilder.bat`
5. Make or have a Paper minecraft server and just put `Asher.jar` in the plugins folder.

## Enjoy your very own username protected plugin! 👍
